The folder structure for the backend of THE HUDA PROJECT app attempts to show the separation of software layers following the principles of clean architecture. The functions in each layer are grouped according to the application object to which those functions are specific. This grouping is reflected by the file names and the containing classes. The use of classes for grouping is mainly for the purpose of clarity throughout the application (eg when a function in the ```SessionController``` class is called anywhere in the applicaiton, it is instantly obvious that it is a controller).
